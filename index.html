      My experience of 16 years in Quality Analysis and technique has prepared me for the duties and responsibilities outlined in the job descriptions and qualifications. As a QA lead, I have contributed a great deal to the improvement of QA processes resulting to reduced test times and increased test coverage of our projects. I have analyzed test results and created various progress reports including risk analysis and communicated these to upper management. I am experienced in managing onshore and offshore resources within budget by which test executions were never compromised. I coordinated cross-functional teams in executing and delivering the task in a timely fashion. Provided support and mentored junior engineers in their quest to become artisans of their craft. Developed project plans, requirements documentation and collaborated with the cross-functional teams to resolve issues and continually improve. In my career, I have worked with various teams where I had to put on various hats in order to accomplish the task without delay. I have an unquenchable thirst for education and research which helped me to prepare me for any task or other duties assigned to me.
