      <p>
        My experience of 16 years in Quality Analysis and technique has prepared me for the duties and responsibilities that will
        be called upon me for this role. As a QA lead, I have contributed a great deal to the improvement of QA processes
        resulting to reduced test times and increased test coverage of our projects. I have analyzed test results and created
        various progress reports including risk analysis and communicated these to upper management.
        <p>
        </p>
        I am experienced in managing onshore and offshore resources within budget by which test executions were never compromised.
        I coordinated cross-functional teams in executing and delivering the task in a timely fashion. Provided support and
        mentored junior engineers in their quest to become artisans of their craft. Developed project plans, requirements
        documentation and collaborated with the cross-functional teams to resolve issues and continually improve. In my career,
        I have worked with various teams where I had to put on various hats in order to accomplish the task without delay.
        I have an unquenchable thirst for education and research which helped me to prepare for any task or other role assigned
        to me.
